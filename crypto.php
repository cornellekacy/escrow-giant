<h3 align="center">HOW IT WORKS</h3><br><br>
<H2>Create Escrow</H2>
<p>The buyer or seller clicks the Create Escrow Transaction button in the menu and enters the transaction information and options. Registered users save 0.15% on escrow fees and build their trust score to inspire confidence in future transactions.</p>
<br><br>
<h2> Review Terms</h2>
<p>The buyer receives an email inviting them to the escrow. Once they review the escrow settings they send the coins if they agree to the terms of the transaction. At the same time the seller receives an invitation email to the escrow room. The transaction takes place in this room. Transparent and Easy!</p><br><br>
<h2>Complete Transaction</h2>
<p>Once funds are received the seller ships the product or performs the service, etc. The buyer then has an inspection period to receive and inspect the product. If they are satisfied they release the funds to the seller or if there is a problem they can raise a dispute instead.</p>
